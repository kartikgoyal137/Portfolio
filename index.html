        <p>I am a first year UG student at IIT Roorkee. My branch here is Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I'm part of the film making club - 'Cinesec' as a video editor and SDSLabs as a Developer. Majorly oriented towards AI/ML out of interest and also due to my core field of study as college academics. Apart from that I really like to listen to DHH music and watch anime.</p>

            <p id="a">I started diving into ML a few months ago and am really interested in it. My resources include courses by Andrew NG and a few books. Currently I'm into supervised learning and after achieving sufficient knowledge of it, I wish to start studying Reinforcement learning.</p>
            <p id="b">I'm just starting out and this is actually my first WebDev project as part of SDSLabs assignment. I will continue advancing my CSS knowledge and start JS.</p>
            <p id="c">This is also part of my core field of college academics. I've studied python data science libraries such as Pandas and BBeautifulSoup. I wish to dive deeper into them and hopefully work on a large scale data science project by the end of my 1st year.</p>
